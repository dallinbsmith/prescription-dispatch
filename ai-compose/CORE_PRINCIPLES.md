# Core Principles

## Principle 1: Simplicity
Keep code minimal and straightforward. No over-engineering.

## Principle 2: Arrow Functions Only
Use arrow function syntax for all functions. Never use `function` keyword.

## Principle 3: Type Safety
Use TypeScript with strict types. No `any` types.

## Principle 4: Single Responsibility
Each function does one thing well.

## Principle 5: No External Dependencies
Use only Node.js built-in modules. No npm packages.
